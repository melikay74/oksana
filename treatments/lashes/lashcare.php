	<h3>How to Care for Your Lashes</h3>
	
	<p class="descr">
		<strong>BEFORE your Lash Extensions</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Prior to arriving at your appointment, it is important that you thoroughly remove all make up you may have on your eyes, this includes mascara, eyeliner, eye shadow and foundation. If not properly removed, the bonding agent may mix with the makeup residue, making it nearly impossible to apply lashes successfully and decrease their longevity.
				</li>
				<li>Contact lenses cannot be worn during the treatment, as your eyes are closed the entire time. It is advisable that you bring with you your contact lens case so that you may store them while your treatment goes on.							
				</li>
				<li>Do not curl your lashes.</li>
				<li>We suggest that you reschedule to get eyelash extensions if you have conjunctivitis, sty, itchiness, redness, swelling or a rash in or around your eyes. We also recommend customers who have a cold or a going through seasonal allergies to reschedule the eyelash extension procedure.</li>
			</ul>

			<strong>AFTER care instructions</strong>
			<br />
