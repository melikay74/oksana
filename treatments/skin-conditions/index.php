				<p>Skin Conditions are the result of an internal imbalance or topical duress. You can have several skin conditions at once, and they can change based on what season it is and what your stress level or diet is like. I will choose for you the treatments, products and ingredients that work to balance these skin conditions.

					<p class="conddescr">Affecting nearly 45 million Americans each year, acne is the most prevalent skin condition in humans. Typically, acne develops where there is an abundance of oil glands, like the face, scalp, chest, back and neck. While acne is common, it also varies and can be made up of a complex combination of needs to treat. Seeing a professional is the best way to ensure that this condition is treated appropriately and specific to each person’s unique needs.</p>

					<p class="conddescr">Oily, congested with blackheads skin types, usually concerned with enlarged pores and greasy appearance.  The overproduction of oil is the main cause of the blackheads. A blackhead, or open comedo  is a widened hair follicle which is filled with skin debris, bacteria and oil.  Blackheads are said to be the first stage of acne.</p>

				<div class="trtmntdetails pigment">
					<img class="floatright" src="/images/cond-spots.jpg"  alt="hyper-pigmentation skin condition" />
					<p class="conddescr">Hyperpigmentation is described as areas of abnormal darkening of the skin. This darkening can either be one spot or large patchy areas, depending on the cause. This condition is a result of inflammation and can be triggered by sun exposure, hormone fluctuations or skin injuries (acne lesions, a cut or a burn). Some skin types are more susceptible to hyperpigmentation than others. It is important to consult with a licensed skin health professional what product to use for this skin condition.
						<ul>
							<li>Inflammation (caused by sun exposure, acne, hormonal shifts, or a cut or burn)</li>
							<li>The pigment is distributed like an umbrella to protect the skin cells’ DNA from damage</li>

				<div class="trtmntdetails aging">
					<img class="floatright" src="/images/cond-aging.jpg"  alt="aging skin condition" />
					<p class="conddescr">Aging of the skin can be put into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic.<br />
					<strong>Intrinsic aging</strong> happens naturally over time and is determined by a person’s genetics. Mild facial wrinkling, expression lines, and dry, sensitive skin are likely a result of intrinsic aging.<br />
					<strong>Extrinsic aging</strong> is a result of external factors like unprotected sun exposure, smoking, alcohol use, pollution and other lifestyle choices. Extrinsic factors are thought to be responsible for 85% of visible aging and are highly avoidable. Sun exposure is the leading cause of extrinsic aging; the suns damaging rays breakdown the skins support structure, leading to discoloration of the skin, wrinkles, sagging and, in some cases even cancer. When treating visible facial aging, it is important to use products that not only treat existing conditions, but also protect the skin from future damage.
						<ul>
							<li>Collagen and elastin break down and their production decreases</li>
							<li>Fine lines and wrinkles appear due to a lack of collagen and elastin support</li>
							<li>Cell turnover rates and hydrating components decrease, leading to dry, flaky skin</li>
							<li>Sun-induced skin discolorations often occur</li>
						</ul>

        		<h2>Dry and Dehydrated</h2>
				<div class="trtmntdetails dry">
					<p class="conddescr">Dry or Dehydrated skin lacks sufficient amounts of water (moisture). Dehydration can lead to oil production or dryness, if not balanced quickly. The skin will start to produce more oils when dehydration sets in, to limit damage from lack of protection at the skin’s surface.  Using products with irritating ingredients can worsen the condition over time.</p>

				<div class="trtmntdetails sensitive">
					<img class="floatright" src="/images/cond-sensitive.jpg"  alt="sensitive skin condition" />
					<p class="conddescr">Sensitive skin can present itself in a variety of ways. Patients typically experience a combination of irritation, discomfort, bumps, redness and inflammation of the skin. Dermatitis (commonly referred to as eczema), rosacea and psoriasis are classified as sensitive skin conditions. While it is unclear what specific factors lead to a person having truly sensitive skin, it is possible for skin to become sensitized from over-exposure to harsh topical ingredients or climate. Fragrances, lanolin, formaldehyde, latex and menthol are common irritants that contribute to sensitization of the skin and can lead to contact dermatitis. The use of aggressive chemical and mechanical exfoliants can also increase skin irritation. Always consult a licensed professional for a treatment plan tailored to address the underlying causes and symptoms of your unique sensitive skin.
					<ul>
						<li>An impaired barrier leads to constant moisture loss</li>
						<li>Dry, flaky skin is common</li>
						<li>Visible redness is a sign of underlying and superficial inflammation</li>
						<li>Blood vessels are larger and, therefore, more visible</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="trtmntdetails sensitive">
					<img class="floatright" src="/images/cond-rosacea.jpg"  alt="rosacea condition" />
					<p class="conddescr">Generally, rosacea is characterized by persistent redness and breakouts on the central areas of the face, typically affecting the nose, cheeks, forehead and chin. Though there is not a known cure for rosacea, many have seen positive results from medical therapies coupled with cosmeceutical products and professional treatments.</p>
