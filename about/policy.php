			<p class="intro">Oksana Skin Esthetics is committed to make your experience most memorable. To ensure a pleasurable experience you are required to review and observe my salon etiquette: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Appointments</strong> - Call for an appointment, or book on line. We require a valid credit card for first time customers only. If we are closed, please <span>leave a message</span> with a preferable date, time and return phone number. Calls will be returned the next business day or as soon as possible.</li>
				<li><strong>Arrival Time</strong> - Please arrive at least <span>10 minutes prior to your appointment</span> time. A late arrival will deprive you of treatment time since we end all appointments on time to respect the next scheduled guests.</li>
				<li><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong> - Cancellation must be made at least <span>1 day (24 hours)</span> prior to your appointment time. If you do not give 24 hours advance notice you will be charged 1/2 of the scheduled session. This amount will be added to your next scheduled appointment.
				<li><strong>History Cards</strong> - Each client is required <span>to fill out a confidential History Card</span>. For best results, it is imperative that you inform me of any conditions, medications, dermatological issues that could adversely affect waxing, micro-dermabrasion, chemical peels, etc.</li>
				<li><strong>During your treatment</strong> I will leave the room either to get fresh water for the facial or to allow you to relax, or to greet my next client.</li>
				<li><strong>Parking</strong> - Parking on Beverly Blvd in front of the salon is ONE HOUR only. <span>Free parking</span> is available behind the salon. Please, park at the <span>2nd and 3rd alleys</span> from 76 Gas Station. Park only in the spots marked for "Oksana Skin Esthetics."</li>
				<li><strong>Right of Refusal</strong> - Oksana Skin Esthetics reserves the <span>right to refuse service</span>. Inappropriate conduct or language during a service will result in immediate termination of the service. I reserve the right to define inappropriate conduct or language.</li>
				<li><strong>Noise</strong> - The neighboring business sometimes makes noise, but I'll do my best to maintain a serene atmosphere. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<br /><br />
		
			<p>If you have any questions please feel free to contact me. I look forward to serving you!</p>
